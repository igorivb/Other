----- Why do we need it:
1. easier to write tests: less test harness code 
2. no external input or output files

----- Problems:
1. Documentation is severely lacking! Almost no examples online.
But MrUnit distribution contains some tests, so we need study them more.

2. Tests are not executed in distributed way (I didn't check it but found in internet)
